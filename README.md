# Nadia's Garden Restaurant

This is a website for a **fictional** restaurant, able to order pizzas online. 

Intended purely for practicing Django's native form framework, Django Forms. I am using Model Forms, to automatically create a form from an existing model, and Form Sets, allowing to easily multiply a form for efficient data entry.
